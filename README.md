“IOT BASED DEVICE FOR ASSESSING MAGNETIC FIELD OF BAR MAGNET AND METHOD OF ASSESSMENT THEREOF”


## Overview
This project focuses on developing an IoT-based device that can assess the magnetic field of a bar magnet using an innovative method involving induced electromotive force (EMF). The device utilizes the principles of electromagnetic induction, eddy currents, and Lenz-Faraday laws to compute and determine the magnetic field strength.

## Patent Information
- **Patent Title:** IoT-Based Device for Assessing Magnetic Field of Bar Magnet and Method of Assessment Thereof
- **Application Number:** 202311002653
- **Publication Date:** 20/01/2023
- **Field of Invention:** Bio-Medical Engineering

## Methodology
The system operates based on the following steps:

1. **Inducing EMF:** When a bar magnet falls through a hollow copper tube, it induces an EMF due to electromagnetic induction.
2. **Generation of Eddy Currents:** The induced EMF causes the electrons in the copper tube to circulate, generating eddy currents.
3. **Energy Production:** The energy imparted to electrons is determined according to Lenz-Faraday’s law.
4. **Computational Analysis:** The system computes essential parameters such as:
   - Mass of the magnet
   - Gravitational force
   - Height of fall
   - Time of descent
   - Charge of an electron
   - Area of the hollow copper tube
5. **Magnetic Field Calculation:** Using the computed values, the magnetic field strength of the bar magnet is determined.

## Features
- **IoT Integration:** Real-time data collection and analysis through an IoT-based system.
- **Automated Calculations:** Determines magnetic field strength using fundamental physics principles.
- **Non-Invasive Measurement:** Magnetic field assessment without direct contact.
- **Patent Published:** Recognized and documented as an innovative method in bio-medical engineering.
